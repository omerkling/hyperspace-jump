# hyperspace-jump
Infinite forward platforming game set in a hyperspace tunnel

This is a prototype game I made while learning Unity and is not a finished project, just to let me experiment with level generation.

The spaceship model is from the Unity Asset Store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/galactic-heroes-cartoon-spaceship-70188 and must be used within the terms of that EULA.
